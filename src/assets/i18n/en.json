        "Biography": "I am a Lebanese born Fashion Designer who spent most of my life in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and graduated from IED (European Institute of Design) in Venice , Italy. Weird combination of countries , I know , but it is exactly that melting pot of cultures this gave me the ability to speak English , Arabic , French & Italian and get inspiration for my collections. After completing my studies in 2019 , I launched my first mini collection , Touch of Africa , and then a second one called Shades of White just a couple of months later. The reaction that I got from people around me and something about seeing people excited to wear clothes that I have designed gave me the push to start my own brand , LY's couture. LY's couture is focused on creating clothes that are suitable to wear for any occasion from daily activities to weddings and even red carpet events ! You tell us your style , we bring it to life."

        "Levis": "As part of a shop opening , and upon request from Levi's , my team and I worked together to produce three denim outfits. The outfits were made to match the theme of the 2019 Venice carnival since the shop opening landed on that day and the opening was in Venice , Italy. We walked around Venice with mannequins wearing to outfits and ended our day at the Levi's shop by putting the outfits on display.",
        "Banco": "A time travel collaboration project with Banco Lotto NO.10 that involved visiting and re-imagining the past. The concept was to create a 1950s themed outfit with puffy sleeves inspired by Cristobal Balenciaga by using only denim fabric. The project was also considered as my personal thesis at the European Institue of Design."
