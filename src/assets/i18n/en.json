        "Biography": "Getting to know different cultures hasn't always been easy.  I am Lebanese by birth but I have spent almost my entire life in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Or how I like to call it , <i>home</i>. Everything about the Congo is an inspiration for me and that's why you will often see the traditional Congolese dresscode integrated swiftly into my designs. I find myself using the wax fabric almost subconciously and I think it's because the colors remind me of the nature there. Also, the fact that I spent my university years in Venice, Italy really gave me the inspiration to try and mix in some of the aspects of western fashion with Congolese fashion when designing.Developing the ability to speak English , French , Arabic & Italian has made it a lot easier for me in order to try and get to know the completely different cultures better in order to find enough similarities between them that I can use in my designs."

        "Levis": "As part of a shop opening , and upon request from Levi's , my team and I worked together to produce three denim outfits. The outfits were made to match the theme of the 2019 Venice carnival since the shop opening landed on that day and the opening was in Venice , Italy. We walked around Venice with mannequins wearing to outfits and ended our day at the Levi's shop by putting the outfits on display.",
        "Banco": "A time travel collaboration project with Banco Lotto NO.10 that involved visiting and re-imagining the past. The concept was to create a 1950s themed outfit with puffy sleeves inspired by Cristobal Balenciaga by using only denim fabric. The project was also considered as my personal thesis at the European Institue of Design."
