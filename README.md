# Fashion Designer Portfolio

A freelance project for a client who happens to be a fashion designer. The requirements were to make a static portfolio website where the client is able to showcase her work in fashion along with her CV and other information.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) because I was interested in learning Angular at the time and the client had mentioned that the website might scale up to become an online store later on.

The website is question can be found [here](https://lilianeyahfoufi.com). It is completely responsive and should look just as great on mobile as on desktop. The user can choose to browse the website in English , French or Italian.

The client has given me permission to be able to share it here in order to showcase my work since it is simply a static website so far. The client will confirm this if need be.
